/*size_t is Used for a count of bytes.  It is the result of the sizeof operator. Size of the objects in bytes.
According to the C language standard, it shall be an  un‚Äê
signed  integer  type capable of storing values in the range [0,
SIZE_MAX]. It is used for array indexing, memory sizes, or anything related to size/length*/
/*const char is a character that cannot be changed. used for read-only strings, or when you want to make sure
a function does not modify the string it receives*/
/*the return type is size_t because strlen() returns the number of bytes rather than the number of characters in a string.*/
